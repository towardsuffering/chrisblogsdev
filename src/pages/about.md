Hello, my name is Chris. Originally from Fort Collins, CO, i'm now living in Nashville, TN, after a sunny stint in Saint Petersburg, FL. My life has fluctuated, from skiing and BMX racing in my youth to diving deep into academia and technology as an adult.

I hold a BS in Operations and Information Management and an MS in Business Analytics from CU Boulder, and I completed my MBA in Music Business at MTSU. My 12-year career spans retail to corporate, where I've honed my skills in Python, JS, SQL, and more.

My vision is centered on my love for all things music and AI. I picked up the guitar during COVID-19 and haven't put it down since. I also have a profound interest in machine learning algorithms and neural networks.

I enjoy reading, learning spanish, creating content, the joy of caring for my cat and dog, and the quest for love and partnership. I'm actively shaping a future filled with family warmth, financial stability, and the thrill of travel while savoring the journey itself.

#### Creative Innovator

- My passion lies in innovation and creativity. Words like "Initiate," "Craft," and "Synergy" are the tools I use to mold the future. I believe in the power of turning imaginative ideas into tangible realities.

#### Tech Enthusiast

- I am at my most enthusiastic about tech. "Database," "Node," and "Program" are more than just terms to me; they represent a world of endless learning, exploration, and creativity.

#### Nature Advocate

- My connection with nature and the importance of balance in life is reflected in words like "Tree," "Root," and "Elastic." I understand that growth is a journey, one that requires resilience, adaptability, and most importantly, intuition.
